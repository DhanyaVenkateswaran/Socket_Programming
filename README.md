# Socket Programming

# About 
A series of network protocols simulated as a part of the computer networks course. All protocols have been simulated using sockets in C programming language.

> The protocols simulated are:
1. [HTTP](https://github.com/DhanyaVenkateswaran/Socket_Programming/tree/main/HTTP_Simulation) - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
2. [FTP](https://github.com/DhanyaVenkateswaran/Socket_Programming/tree/main/FTP_Simulation ) - File Transfer Protocol
3. [SMTP](https://github.com/DhanyaVenkateswaran/Socket_Programming/tree/main/SMTP_Simulation ) - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
4. [DNS]() - Domain Name System ( This protocol was simulated in a iterative fashion )
5. [Multiclient chatting using TCP](https://github.com/DhanyaVenkateswaran/Socket_Programming/tree/main/Multiclient_Chatting_Using_TCP ) ( Transmission Control Protocol )
